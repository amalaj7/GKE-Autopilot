# GKE - Autopilot 
-------------------------

- Autopilot is a new mode of operation in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) that is designed to reduce the operational cost of managing clusters, optimize your clusters for production, and yield higher workload availability. 

- It is fully managed Kubernetes engine that allows you to focus more on application structure than managing cluster infrastructures .

- With Autopilot, you no longer have to monitor the health of your nodes or calculate the amount of compute capacity that your workloads require.
